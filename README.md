# Snooze
During lockdown, since we are all in our homes, we spend plenty of time in front of the computers. While doing so we often forget to drink water at intervals. Water not only helps us to rehydrate our body but it also provides us freshness and relieve our stress and mental fatigue. This small project helps you remind drinking water at specific intervals so that you never have to keep a track of the clock.
